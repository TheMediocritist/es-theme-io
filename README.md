# Io
A theme for Emulationstation and RetroPie


##About

Io is a simple black and white theme created for EmulationStation and RetroPie. Well, not exactly black and white. I found the pure white to be too bright on the eyes, so I toned it down to #0c0c0c and #d8d8d8.

The Detailed View shows all metadata except for the Publisher. I had to sacrifce something for space, and that one seemed like the best to remove.

I used the same system folders as Carbon V2.0.4. I also used the .svg images from Carbon, but changed all the colours to #0c0c0c and #d8d8d8 (that was time consuming) so they fit the theme.

##Notes

- This theme has not been tested with a 4/3 ratio. You may come across some ugliness with the metadata on the Detailed view.
- This theme probably won't look very good on smaller screens (such as hand-helds) due to the amount of content on the Detailed View.
- This theme currently doesn't take into account either the GridView Mod, or the Child-Friendly versions of EmulationStation, but there are plans for them in the future.
